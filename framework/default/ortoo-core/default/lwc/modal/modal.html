        Remove formatted modal, and move it all into here.
        Add the cancel cross - don't forget to test it.
        You can't have a modal that isn't formatted because of the way the header contains the cancel button

        The modal should have a background that includes the right level of padding and suchlike, so a form without formatting can be added

        Create standard save buttons and extract from the view and edit form.

        Change the selection criteria edit form so that it no longer uses the view and edit form.

        Construct the modal with the right title / buttons and edit form in the definer

        Consider making an 'edit modal' that takes a title and form and handles the save and edit buttons?
