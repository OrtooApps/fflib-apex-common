Look at the use of 'MockDatabase' in fflib

Look at:
    SobjectUtils.getSobjectName

* LWCs

    * Review:
        * Read Only Field
        * Self Configured Combobox

    * Create exception rendering / error rendering

    * Make a page for LWCs
    * Document:
        * Modal

    * Try parent and datatable referencing a DML Service

* Standards
    * data-name to identify elements in a test
        * e.g. [data-name="cancel"]
    * Labels should be:
        * Imported into a static named _LABEL
        * Referenced in an object named 'labels'.
        * E.g.
        labels = {
            confirm: CONFIRM_LABEL
        }
        * so in the html it's {labels.confirm}



* To finalise the core architecture:
    * Do we need to have a non all-or-nothing version of commitWork?

Add to documentation
    * Wrapping exceptions on the way out of services
    * Query builder - add it to the architectural diagram - after more investigation

    DmlServices documentation:
        * Show how to tie the validator into an action
        * Note that the actions should
        * Actions can reference Validators
        * Cannot reference SOQL - they are excuted in a loop
        * Do not do domain logic in them

    * Using the Mock Registarar

From Utilities, things that may be useful:
    * getReferenceObjectAPIName
    * getObjName - get the object name from an Id
    * getLabel / getObjectLabel - get the label for an sobject
    * getFieldLabel
    * delimitedStringToSet and reverse
        * escaping single quotes - in both directions?
    * unitsBetweenDateTime
    * emailAddressIsValid / emailAddressListIsValid
    * sObjectIsCustom / sObjectIsCustomfromAPIName
    * IsfieldFilterable
    * isFieldCustom
    * idIsValid
    * getCrossObjectAPIName
    * objectFieldExist
    * sortSelectOptions - complete re-write

Write tests for the SOQL generation in the criteria library

Amoss_Asserts.assertContains improvement into the OS lib
New Amoss_Asserts into the OS Lib

Bring in Stack from Q-assign?
Review Utilities in q-assign - is anything else useful?



* Document a few of the oddities on the Assignment Group and Action that need to be resolved.


Bad Smells - strung out calls to describe methods - put them into SobjectUtils


* Build some example unit tests...
* Criteria extension
    * Build a simple SearchFilter SOQL generator / Selector

* Question: How do we generically tie in the QueryHandler?  Should we?  How often is this currently used?
* Question: Standard - never instantiate a Domain within a loop

* Question: How do we handle Constants - where are they defined?
* Question: How do we handle Exceptions:
    * Do we handle individual types of exception in the Service?
    * Do we pass any of the domain exceptions back

* Question: Multiple Apps...  maybe

* Question: Can we generate a class diagram from a body of code
* Question: All or nothing on fflib

* Question: Do you need Heap size management rules -

* Produce test-case for lack of clickthrough and raise bug on VSCode

* How do we handle constants?

* Dynamic building of the Unit Of Work for processing data

Notes:
* Services should always be designed by seniors - at least which services exist
